# Classification
In this repository I use some methods such as logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neghbors and SVM to classification some dataset wich you can observe them here.
## Classification_cell_saples_dataset
In this project I worked with `cell_samples.csv` dataset. The porpuse of this project was binary classification.

I used 4 methods wich mentions blew to classification then compare their accuracy.
- SVM
- K-nearest neghbors(KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
